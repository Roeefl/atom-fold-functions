# Fold Functions

Folds functions within your code. Currently comes with a toggle, fold, and unfold option that will look for functions marked with 'meta.function'. Handy because it won't fold things like comments associated with functions.

*Note: this currently folds only those functions it finds at a single indentation (e.g. it will fold the top level functions)*

Heavily inspired/influnced by [Fold Comments](https://atom.io/packages/fold-comments).
